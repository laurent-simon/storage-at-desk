#summary Describes how to setup a mysql database for storage@desk
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Storage@Desk requires a MySQL database to hold volume information.

= Requirements =
* MySQL 5.0.3 or newer

= Create The Database =

Run the provided `sd.sql` as root.  This will create an empty database named `Storage@Desk` with the appropriate scheme and stored procedures.

= Create A User =

Now create a user and give them full access to the `Storage@Desk` database.  You will need 
to allow connections from this user from any address, eg `user_name@%`.

= Details =

  * Only the `Volume Controller` talks to the database
  * Because of the way the `Volume Controller` is currently set up you *MUST* explicitly allow `user_name@%` and not simply the host from which the `Volume Controller` will be running on.  This should be probably be fixed.
